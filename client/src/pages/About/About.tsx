                Each of us uses the services of freelancers from time to time. We do this to get the job done quickly and well. By creating Kwork, we strive to bring the idea of convenience and speed of freelancing to perfection. </p>
            <p>
                We believe that:
            </p>
            <p>
                Freelancing should be simple and clear. Therefore, placing an order on Kwork is as easy as adding an item to the shopping cart. No long and tedious negotiations with the performers. Found the right service, clicked "Order" and waiting for the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freelancing should save time, not take it away. Kwork welcomes fast and responsible freelancers by displaying their services above others. And the services of irresponsible performers are hidden from the catalog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freelancing should be safe. How disappointing it is when a freelancer, having taken an advance payment, disappears into oblivion. Personal time wasted, money lost and deadlines missed. Therefore, you can instantly return funds to Kwork in case of delay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life is beautiful, and each of us has so much to do. I want to breathe deeply. To do this, we try to create comfort and convenience around us. And in everything: in their clothes, at home and at work, as well as in their affairs. Freelancing is no exception. And so we launched Kwork.
